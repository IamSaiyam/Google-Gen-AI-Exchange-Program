# Develop GenAI Apps with Gemini and Streamlit: Google Cloud Challenge Lab Walkthrough

This is a walkthrough of the challenge lab from the course Develop GenAI Apps with Gemini and Streamlit. I’ll show you how to complete the lab, but also help explain concepts along the way.

In this lab, we will be creating a proof-of-concept AI-Based **Chef app**. It will test our ability to:

* Run **Jupyter notebooks** in **Google Vertex AI Workbench**.

* Use the **Gemini Pro **multimodal foundation model.

* Use **cURL to test our Gemini Pro API calls**.

* Use the **Streamlit **framework for our application UI.

* **Containerise **the application and push to the **Google Artifact Registry**.

* **Deploy **our application from Artifact Registry to **Cloud Run**.

It’s a pretty easy lab, and probably takes around 30–40 minutes… Even with the slow image build and deploy steps.

## Intro to Challenge Labs

Google provides an online learning platform called Google [Cloud Skills Boost](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/), formerly known as QwikLabs. On this platform, you can follow training courses aligned to learning paths, to particular products, or for particular solutions.

One type of learning experience on this platform is called a **quest**. This is where you complete a number of guided hands-on labs, and then finally complete a **Challenge Lab**. The **challenge lab** differs from the other labs in that goals are specified, but very little guidance on *how* to achieve the goals is given.

I occasionally create walkthroughs of these challenge labs. The goal is not to help you cheat your way through the challenge labs! But rather:

* To show you what I believe to be an ideal route through the lab.

* To help you with particular gotchas or blockers that are preventing you from completing the lab on your own.

If you’re looking for help with this challenge lab, then you’ve come to the right place. But I strongly urge you to work your way through the quest first, and to try the lab on your own, before reading further!

With all these labs, there are always many ways to go about solving the problem. I generally like to solve them using the Cloud Shell, since I can then document a more repeatable and programmatic approach. But of course, you can use the Cloud Console too.

### Initial Setup

Let’s start by defining some variables we can use throughout this challenge. The actual variables will be provided to you when you start the lab.

    # authenticate
    gcloud auth list
    
    # Set environment variables
    export PROJECT=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
    export REGION=<ENTER ZONE>

### Task 1 — Use cURL to test a prompt with the API

* First, navigate to Vertex AI → Workbench → User-Managed Notebooks.

* Click on Open Jupyterlab.

![Jupyter Lab](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3524/1*dkGv4dGY9BnVT8HfLxMbQA.png)*Jupyter Lab*

* Open a terminal from the Jupyter Lab environment, and then copy the provided Jupyter notebook from Google Cloud Storage, using the instruction provided. This notebook is where we’ll test our Gemini Pro API calls.

    gsutil cp gs://spls/gsp517/prompt.ipynb .

* The notebook will appear in the navigation menu on the left. Open this notebook.

![Opening the notebook](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3940/1*4XhNRd465V8CW48H2MSG2A.png)*Opening the notebook*

* Provide your project ID and region.

* Replace the prompt, using the lengthy prompt supplied in the lab.

* Now run all the cells. The last cell runs a cURL command to the Gemini Pro API, as a bash command. The output looks a bit like this:

![Running the notebook cells](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2886/1*AQfYOB0wYU-qH_3vUjF1jg.png)*Running the notebook cells*

* Save the modified prompt.ipynb.

### Task 2 — Complete chef.py

From Cloud Shell, clone the GitHub repo, and then download the chef.py from the supplied GCS bucket:

    # clone repo and change to this directory
    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai.git
    cd generative-ai/gemini/sample-apps/gemini-streamlit-cloudrun
    
    # Download chef.py from GCS
    gsutil cp gs://spls/gsp517/chef.py .

* Now we examine chef.py from the Cloud Shell Editor. It is a Python Streamlit application that uses Gemini to generate content.

![chef.py](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3710/1*z01wY6O2EJTmQTCzSOpbAA.png)*chef.py*

* We’re asked to add a radio button to select Red, White, or None for wine, and we’re asked to substitute the new prompt supplied in the lab:

![Modifying chef.py](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2348/1*hwf2k5wYT-AXyhtQSvhWzA.png)*Modifying chef.py*

* Now upload the modified chef.py back to GCS, from Cloud Shell. (Note that your directory will be different.) We’re only doing this, because it’s required to validate step completion in the challenge lab.

    gcloud storage cp chef.py gs://qwiklabs-gcp-01-d2f0e6cd7ad5-generative-ai/

### Task 3 — Test the Application

Now we’ll test the application.

First, let’s setup our Python virtual environment and install application dependencies. In case this is new to you: a Python virtual environment is a Python context where we can install Python packages in a manner that is isolated from any other Python runtime environment. In short: they isolate Python project dependencies.

Our current folder already contains a requirements.txt, so we can easily install our required Python packages into our newly created virtual environment.

    # Setup Python env
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

And now we run our Streamlit chef.py application locally:

    streamlit run chef.py \
      --browser.serverAddress=localhost \
      --server.enableCORS=false \
      --server.enableXsrfProtection=false \
      --server.port 8080

We can test it in the browser:

![Running the Streamlit app locally](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2740/1*ewTLyeqwKQiatrnlKnKM-Q.png)*Running the Streamlit app locally*

Let’s try it out:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2568/1*C1MWTwkfc6_ZPZLiAz2FMw.png)

Ooh, that’s sounds delicious. I might have to make that later!

We can now press Ctrl-C in Cloud Shell to terminate the application.

### Task 4 — Containerise and Push to Artifact Registry

First, we’re told to modify the existing Dockerfile to use our chef.py. This is trivial to do. Just edit the Dockerfile in the same folder, using Cloud Shell Editor:

![Update Dockerfile to use chef.py](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3628/1*QQA2GbdpUvbZRnlE8fuu7w.png)*Update Dockerfile to use chef.py*

Now we’re told to set new two environment variables. Do this from Cloud Shell. These environment variables will be used when we build our image and deploy to Cloud Run.

    export AR_REPO=chef-repo
    export SERVICE_NAME=chef-streamlit-app

Now create a repository in Google Cloud Artefact Registry, and then build our Docker image and push it to GAR:

    # Create a GAR repo
    gcloud artifacts repositories create "$AR_REPO" \
      --location="$REGION" --repository-format=Docker
    
    # Build to GAR - this takes a few minutes
    gcloud builds submit \
      --tag "$REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT/$AR_REPO/$SERVICE_NAME"

So far, so good!

![Build result](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2900/1*JpL4U5iZpIQ-UxG0w5cgyQ.png)*Build result*

### Task 5 — Deploy to Cloud Run and Test

Finally, we’re ready to deploy to Cloud Run:

    # Deploy to Cloud Run - this takes a couple of minutes
    gcloud run deploy "$SERVICE_NAME" \
      --port=8080 \
      --image="$REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT/$AR_REPO/$SERVICE_NAME" \
      --allow-unauthenticated \
      --region=$REGION \
      --platform=managed  \
      --project=$PROJECT \
      --set-env-vars=GCP_PROJECT=$PROJECT,GCP_REGION=$REGION

Note how we’re setting environment variables for our Cloud Run instance, passing in the environment variables we defined previously.

![gcloud run deploy](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3538/1*m38fgFbIG0baGzRI9pVBxg.png)*gcloud run deploy*

Let’s open the Cloud Run URL, and check the app works:

![Our Chef application running in Cloud Run](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3160/1*0t5FyQgNwMh9tEtrpdRS4g.png)*Our Chef application running in Cloud Run*

Now I fancy a Mexican dish… And I’ll avoid paprica, as it gives me migraines!

## Wrap Up

Hurrah!! All done!

***Isn’t it amazing how easy it is to build a GenAI-based recipe application and deploy it to Cloud Run?***
