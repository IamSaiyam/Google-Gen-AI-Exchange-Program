# 🎯 Prompt Design in Vertex AI — Skill Badge (Google Cloud)

This repository contains my work and learnings from completing the **Prompt Design in Vertex AI** course and challenge lab, as part of the **Google GenAI Exchange Program**.

> ✅ **Status**: Completed all 4/4 labs  
> 🏅 **Badge Earned**: [Prompt Design in Vertex AI Skill Badge](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/976)  
> ⏱️ **Duration**: ~3 hours 45 minutes  
> 🔰 **Level**: Introductory  
> 💡 **Skills**: Prompt Engineering, Vertex AI, Generative AI SDK, Image Analysis, Multimodal Input, Gemini Models

## 🧠 What I Learned

The course focused on applying **Generative AI techniques** through Google Cloud’s **Vertex AI Studio** and the **Gen AI SDK**. I gained hands-on experience in:

### 1. 🔧 Prompt Engineering
- Writing clear, goal-oriented prompts.
- Controlling output using parameters (`temperature`, `max_tokens`, etc.).
- Using few-shot examples to improve consistency.

### 2. 🧪 Experimentation with Gemini Models
- Analyzing and describing images with Gemini using Vertex AI Studio.
- Generating emotionally resonant, brand-specific taglines.
- Adjusting model behavior with system instructions and inputs.

### 3. 👨‍💻 Python SDK Integration
- Exported prompts to Python using Vertex AI’s “Build with Code” feature.
- Ran and modified prompts in Jupyter Notebooks.
- Explored use of SDK for repeatable, parameterized GenAI tasks.

### 4. 🌐 Multimodal & Creative AI Design
- Combined text and image inputs for richer prompt scenarios.
- Designed creative output constraints (poetic tone, keyword inclusion, etc.).
- Tuned prompts to shift between literal and abstract outputs.

## 📚 Labs Completed

| Lab Title | Key Focus |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Generative AI with Vertex AI: Prompt Design** | Prompt structure, goal-oriented phrasing |
| **Get Started with Vertex AI Studio** | Hands-on with Gemini, UI-driven prototyping |
| **Getting Started with Gen AI SDK** | SDK-based prompting and code integration |
| **Prompt Design in Vertex AI: Challenge Lab** | Applied skills to a real-world case (Cymbal Direct) with Jupyter notebooks and creative prompt crafting |

## 📌 Notes & Reflections

- Prompt clarity is more powerful than verbosity.
- Few-shot examples dramatically improve alignment with desired tone and format.
- Python SDK enables reproducibility and fine-tuning—ideal for production workflows.
- System instructions in Gemini are crucial to shaping the style and direction of outputs.
- The challenge lab felt like a real-world brief: no step-by-step guidance, just tools and a goal.
