## 📚 Overview

This course teaches how to build real-world GenAI applications using Google Cloud’s **Vertex AI** with the **Gemini** and **Imagen** models. Through 4 hands-on labs, I learned to create image recognition, image generation, and chat-based applications, including multi-modal pipelines combining both image and text inputs.

## 🧪 Labs Summary

### ✅ 1. Build an AI Image Recognition App using Gemini on Vertex AI
**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Skills:** Image understanding, multimodal AI, natural language processing  
**Summary:**  
Used the Gemini model to interpret and describe content in images by sending image and prompt inputs together. Got back natural language responses based on the visual content.

---

### ✅ 2. Build an AI Image Generator App using Imagen on Vertex AI
**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Skills:** Image generation, prompt engineering  
**Summary:**  
Created images from natural language prompts using the Imagen model. Learned to configure and run `generate_images()` from the Vertex AI SDK to save and visualize AI-generated images.

---

### ✅ 3. Build an Application to Send Chat Prompts using the Gemini Model
**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Skills:** Generative chat AI, streaming responses  
**Summary:**  
Built a conversational app using Gemini with text-only input and both streaming and non-streaming response capabilities. Useful for integrating real-time GenAI responses into chatbots or assistants.

---

### ✅ 4. Build a Multi-Modal GenAI Application: Challenge Lab
**Duration:** 20 minutes  
**Skills:** Multimodal AI integration, image-to-text pipelines  
**Summary:**  
Combined Imagen and Gemini to generate an image and then interpret it. For example, generated a bouquet image and asked Gemini to generate a birthday wish based on the image — a complete GenAI workflow.
