# 🧠 Multimodality with Gemini (GSP1210)

This project is part of the **Google GenAI Exchange Program**.

## 🧪 Lab Summary

This lab introduces **Gemini**, Google’s family of multimodal generative AI models. You use the **Gemini API** with the **Vertex AI Workbench** to explore how **Gemini Flash** can understand and generate content from text, images, audio, and video inputs.

Gemini’s multimodal capabilities empower it to:
- Analyze images (detect UI elements, interpret diagrams, compare visuals)
- Understand videos (generate descriptions, tags, answer contextual questions)
- Process audio for long-context comprehension
- Combine all modalities in a single prompt for holistic reasoning

---

## ✅ What I Learned

- How to send **multimodal prompts** to Gemini using Python and the Vertex AI SDK
- Reasoning across **multiple images** to extract insights (e.g., item pricing, object comparison)
- Generating **video descriptions** and metadata, ideal for media tagging or accessibility
- Using audio inputs for **long-context understanding** like meeting summarization or podcast Q&A
- Applying Gemini to **codebase reasoning**—understanding complex files and refactoring suggestions
- Understanding and extracting relationships from **ER diagrams**
- Comparing images to spot **visual changes or anomalies**
- Leveraging the Gemini API for building **retail product recommendation systems**
- Running all modalities in **interleaved format** for complex, multi-input tasks

## 📝 Notes

- 🔄 **Multimodal Reasoning**: Gemini seamlessly handles image, audio, text, and video together—powerful for building complex AI solutions like educational tutors, virtual assistants, or e-commerce engines.
- 🧠 **Context-Rich Understanding**: Whether it’s a diagram or a full-length video, Gemini can understand and reason with long-form content—vital for workflows in technical documentation, UX research, and product reviews.
- 🧩 **Image Comparison Use Case**: You can prompt Gemini to compare before-and-after images (e.g., surveillance, renovation, damage detection).
- 🎯 **Retail Recommendations**: By analyzing product images, Gemini can suggest visually similar or contextually relevant alternatives.
- 🧬 **Diagram Intelligence**: ERDs, network graphs, or flowcharts can be parsed and converted into structured insights or even SQL.
- 🎧 **Audio Summarization**: Meetings, interviews, or audio files can be summarized, queried, or used for creating highlights.
- 📹 **Video Breakdown**: Gemini can extract rich information from visual frames in a video, such as product tags, scenes, and contextual Q&A.
- 🔍 **All-in-One Prompting**: Great for real-world applications like customer support bots, intelligent search engines, content tagging, and recommendation engines.
- 🧪 **Notebook Integration**: Working in Vertex AI Workbench with JupyterLab makes prototyping seamless with GPU-backed instances.
