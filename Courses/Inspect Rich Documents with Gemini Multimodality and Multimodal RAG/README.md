# 🧠 Inspect Rich Documents with Gemini Multimodality and Multimodal RAG

This README summarizes my learnings and experiences from completing the **"Inspect Rich Documents with Gemini Multimodality and Multimodal RAG"** course as part of the **Google Cloud Skills Boost** program.

---

## 🧪 Course Overview

This intermediate-level course dives deep into Google’s **Gemini API** and its **multimodal capabilities**, covering image, text, and video analysis. Over four hands-on labs, I learned to apply Gemini’s AI to real-world document and media analysis scenarios, culminating in a final **challenge lab** that put these skills to the test.

### 🧩 Labs Completed

1. **Multimodality with Gemini**  
   Explored how Gemini processes combined data types — text, images, and video — to perform complex, context-aware tasks.

2. **Using Gemini for Multimodal Retail Recommendations**  
   Learned how to use Gemini Flash to analyze product data (images and descriptions) and generate intelligent recommendations.

3. **Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Gemini API in Vertex AI**  
   Practiced creating and retrieving context-aware metadata from documents combining image and text, powered by Gemini and Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

4. **Inspect Rich Documents with Gemini Multimodality and Multimodal RAG: Challenge Lab**  
   A capstone challenge testing the ability to apply multimodal reasoning and RAG techniques to extract insights from rich documents and media.

## 📝 Important Notes

- 🔄 **Multimodal Fusion**: Gemini can simultaneously understand and reason across text, images, and video — ideal for scenarios like product analysis, documentation parsing, or campaign evaluation.
- 🧠 **RAG with Media**: Retrieval Augmented Generation is not limited to text — it can integrate images and visual structure for much richer responses.
- 🧪 **Video Intelligence**: Gemini can summarize entire videos, tag objects, and answer contextual questions from video timelines.
- 🧬 **Document Intelligence**: From tables to ERDs to scanned pages — Gemini makes extracting structured data from rich documents seamless.
- 💡 **Helper Functions**: The course provided powerful utility functions to simplify RAG logic, image handling, and embedding comparisons.
- 🧱 **Use Case Readiness**: Skills from this course are applicable to marketing, compliance, content generation, customer support, and more.
